## Overview

Request a verification code, resend a new one, then verify using the old code.

This repository is a **sanitized educational case study**. It does not target a real company or live system. The CTF lab is a mock vulnerable app where the flag unlocks only after reproducing the simulated bug.

## Play the CTF Simulation

Run locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open:

```text

```

```

## What You Must Do

Prove old verification codes remain valid after resend.

## Safety

Use this project only for learning, local labs, and responsible disclosure practice. Do not test destructive actions, IDORs, token exposure, or business-logic abuse against systems you do not own or have permission to test.
